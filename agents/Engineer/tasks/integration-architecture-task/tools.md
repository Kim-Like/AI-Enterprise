# Integration Architecture Task - Tools

## Primary Tooling
- Integration touchpoints: WordPress/cPanel MySQL, Shopify, Brevo, Billy, and datastore exit work.
- FastAPI route contracts, Pydantic validation, and queue context guarantees.
- Automated checks for permission, payload, and retry semantics.

## Control Plane and Verification
- FastAPI endpoints: `/api/tasks`, `/api/errors`, `/api/system-map`, `/api/datastores/verify`.
- Runtime health checks: `/health` and `/api/meta/runtime`.
- Local/Tailscale access: `http://localhost:8001` and `http://100.96.78.62:8001`.

## Security and Reliability Guardrails
- Never hardcode secrets; rely on `.env` and environment injection.
- Validate queue context keys: `program_id`, `scope_path`, `acceptance_criteria`, `dependencies`, `constraints`, `handoff_to`.
- Escalate cross-domain security/reliability incidents to Engineer with error-log traceability.
